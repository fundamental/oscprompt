A generic OSC based prompt for inspecting and manipulating clients.

Dependencies

rtosc
pkg-config
Liblo
cmake

Optional. Only needed for API usage examples of the rtosc sub-library, not oscprompt itself.

Compilation
Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fundamental/oscprompt.git

Pull the rtosc submodule
git submodule update --init

Install dependencies
sudo apt-get install liblo-dev cmake pkg-config

Compile
cmake .
make

Prompt accepts:
 - TAB
 - disconnect
 - quit
 - exit
 - connect 'port number'
 - general OSC messages sent to the client

It assumes that the client will respond to /path-search:ss for tab completion
and field information.

This is currently Beta software and as such expect some interesting behavior
from time to time.
Discussion and bug reports are appreciated.
